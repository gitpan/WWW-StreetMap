    module type the following:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test

    If you do not have Module::Build type:

      perl Makefile.PL

    to fetch it. Or use CPAN or CPANPLUS and fetch it "manually".

DEPENDENCIES
    This module works only with perl v5.6 and higher. I am more than happy
    to backport to an earlier perl 5.x if someone using an old perl would
    like to make use of my module. Mail me and ask me to do the work [or
    even better do it yourself and send in a patch! ;-)]

    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

     Test::More

    Test::More is only required for testing purposes

    This module has these optional dependencies:

     Test::Distribution

    This is just requried for testing purposes.

TODO
    *   Write it!
